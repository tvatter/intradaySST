Non-Parametric Estimation of Intraday Spot Volatility: Disentangling Instantaneous Trend and Seasonality
================================================================

Overview
--------

This is the code which accompanies the paper ["Non-Parametric Estimation of Intraday Spot Volatility: Disentangling Instantaneous Trend and Seasonality"](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2330159)
by Thibault Vatter, Hau-Tieng Wu, Valerie Chavez-Demoulin and Bin Yu.

The code is written in [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.it/products/matlab/); it
provides a function which reads a multiple sequence alignment (in FASTA format)
and returns a ranking of all pairs of residue positions in the aligned
amino-acid sequences.

The code uses some MATLAB MEX files written in C, which need to be compiled; in
case a compiler is not available, it will still work, but it will use (much)
slower fallbacks written in MATLAB code.

Usage
--------

Open and run the file setup.m for examples.
