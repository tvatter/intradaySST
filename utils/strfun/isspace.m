%ISSPACE True for white space characters.
%   For a string S, ISSPACE(S) returns an array the same size as S 
%   containing logical 1 (TRUE) where the elements of S are
%   Unicode-represented whitespace characters and logical 0 (FALSE) where
%   they are not.  
%
%   White space characters for which ISSPACE returns TRUE include tab, line
%   feed, vertical tab, form feed, carriage return, and space, in addition
%   to a number of other Unicode characters.
